qtDom
=====

Small collection of JS scripts. I don't like jQ. I don't like how I have to include _everything_ when all I want is the DOM API.
I hate that, in order to have an easy ajax API, I get a tool that does event handling, delegation, animation and all sorts of junk, when all I want is perform AJAX calls.

That's why I have some small functions lying around that I use in case I want the ease of use of a specific part of jQ, but don't want to include the lot.
And I've decided to start collecting them all here, on github.


Feel free to use, contribute, share...
